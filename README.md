# Sex Differences in Cardio-Embolic Strokes: The Triad of Arrhythmogenesis, Thrombosis, and Inflammation

## Project Description
  * Animal Model
       * Aged (19-23 months old) 15 Ankyrin B (AnkB) mice and 33 C57BL/6 mice
           * 5 WT AnkB Females, 4 WT AnkB Males, 3 Heterozygous AnkB Females, 3 Heterozygous AnkB Males
           * 21 C57BL/6 Males, 12 C57BL/6 Females
       * AnkB mice spontaneously develop atrial fibrillation 
  * DSI telemonitors were surgically implanted into all animals. The following day post-surgery, the C57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with carbachol, a drug that induces atrial fibrillation. The AnkB mice did not receive any injections. EKGs were then recorded for 8 hours and analyzed using LabChart. 

**Softwares Used:** Microsoft Excel, LabChart, GraphPad Prism
