# Sex Differences in Cardio-Embolic Strokes: The Triad of Arrhythmogenesis, Thrombosis, and Inflammation

## Project Description
  * **Animal Model**
       * Aged (19-23 months old) Ankyrin B (AnkB) heterozygous and wild type littermate mice, and C57BL/6J wild type mice, both males and females
  * **Experimental Design**
       * DSI ETA-F10 telemonitors were surgically implanted into all animals. The following day post-surgery, the C57BL/6J mice were injected intraperitoneally with carbachol, a drug that induces atrial fibrillation. The AnkB mice did not receive any injections. EKGs were then recorded for 8 hours and analyzed using LabChart. 

* **Softwares Used:** Microsoft Excel, LabChart, GraphPad Prism
  *  LabChart was used to acquire and analyze the ECG raw data
  *  Microsoft Excel and Prism were both used to analyze the data and generate figures
